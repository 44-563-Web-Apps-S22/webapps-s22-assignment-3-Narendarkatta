      My self Narendar am doing my masters ar north west Missouri state
      university in applied computer sciences and am good at cricket and
      badminton and i love watching sports with friends
    </p>

    <h4>The Shawshank Redemption</h4>
    <p>Movie i watched recently and i liked it very much and i recommend to others.</p>
    <p>
      As per my views this is one of the best film that i have ever seen. it
      teaches the three important lesson in life
      <br />
      <b>Never lose Hope</b>:- Even after surviving 20 years he get out of the
      prison
      <br />
      <b>Life Long Friendship</b> - There is very hard to find a good friend and
      it can be met you anywhere and might be result in a life long friendship
      like Andy Dufresne and red in the movie.
