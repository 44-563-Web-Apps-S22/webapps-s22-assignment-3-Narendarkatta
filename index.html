    <h4>About geometry and elemtory</h4>
      <blockquote>Geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies the sizes, shapes, positions angles and dimensions
        of things. Flat shapes like squares, circles, and triangles are a part of flat geometry and are called 2D shapes.
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>a polygon (/ˈpɒlɪɡɒn/) is a plane figure that is described by a finite number of straight line
        segments connected to form a closed polygonal chain (or polygonal circuit). The bounded plane region, the
        bounding circuit, or the two together, may be called a polygon.
